# Windows Based Malware Prediction System with Deep Learning Models
The project aims at developing a model which accurately predicts the probability that an
operating system (Windows for this project) will be hit by a malware. Its primary goal is malware vulnerability detection among many
operating system versions and building a model which can accurately do the task at hand.
